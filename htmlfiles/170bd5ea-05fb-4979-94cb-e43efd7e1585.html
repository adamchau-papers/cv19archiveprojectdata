Tenn. -- As COVID-19 continues to plague the country, people coming together to defeat the pandemic and the community impact is becoming even more apparent.{\/p}<p>But what's also more apparent is the hatred Asian Americans are facing.{\/p}<p>A local Chinese American organization called US TN Fujian Chamber of Commerce has given away thousands of surgical masks to places like local hospitals, medical centers, and anyone else who needs them.{\/p}<p>&ldquo;So far, we've donated over 15,000 masks to around 9 locations,&rdquo; says organization member Belle Huang.{\/p}<p>Huang says there are about 20 Chinese Americans of all ages in the organization who have donated and raised tens of thousands of dollars to import them from overseas.{\/p}<p>&ldquo;We have connections to Beijing so we're connecting with them and they're shipping it.&rdquo;{\/p}<p>Another local Chinese American group is doing the same.{\/p}<p>TNChinese-HelpDefeatCOVID-19 has raised more than $35,000 and donated 2,000 masks, 21,400 exam gloves, and four protective medical body-suits to hospitals and medical centers.{\/p}<p>But, despite all the good deeds, Asian Americans have become a target for racism.{\/p}<p>The Asian Pacific Policy & Planning Council says there have been 1,100 reports of harassment and physical assault just in the last couple of weeks.{\/p}<p>Verbal incidents like a woman yelling: &ldquo;Get out of our country! Get out. You! Get out of the United States!&rdquo;{\/p}<p>Or physical ones like a woman taking out her trash who was rushed to the hospital after being doused with chemicals that burned her face, neck, shoulders, and back.{\/p}<p>Huang says, thankfully, they haven't experienced that hatred but says it is frustrating and frightening to hear.{\/p}<p>She says they&rsquo;re focusing on the positives and says they will keep doing all they can to help the local community.{\/p}<p>{\/p}"}},"section":{"uuid":"252a34a5-642a-4a8a-8fc4-3bc4d23936c5","created":1438040269000,"version":1,"savedDate":null,"scheduledDate":null,"expiresDate":null,"terminatedDate":null,"publishAuthorizationDate":1560216984000,"unpublishAuthorizationDate":null,"status":"published","propertyTags":null,"zipcode":null,"timezone":null,"name":"Local","pathUrl":"\/local","redirectPathUrl":null,"config":null,"parentChannelProperty":{"uuid":"0adc72e1-1860-4080-aec0-b4d43d69b55e","created":1437778093000,"version":1,"savedDate":null,"scheduledDate":null,"expiresDate":null,"terminatedDate":null,"publishAuthorizationDate":null,"unpublishAuthorizationDate":null,"status":null,"propertyTags":null,"zipcode":"37228","timezone":"EDT","name":"WZTV","channelBrand":null},"parentSection":{"uuid":"2876c505-44c4-4dc1-9939-ea7ed80d900c","created":1437778094000,"version":1,"savedDate":null,"scheduledDate":null,"expiresDate":null,"terminatedDate":null,"publishAuthorizationDate":1553059411000,"unpublishAuthorizationDate":null,"status":null,"propertyTags":null,"zipcode":null,"timezone":null,"name":"News","pathUrl":"\/news","redirectPathUrl":"\/","config":null,"parentChannelProperty":{"uuid":"0adc72e1-1860-4080-aec0-b4d43d69b55e","created":1437778093000,"version":1,"savedDate":null,"scheduledDate":null,"expiresDate":null,"terminatedDate":null,"publishAuthorizationDate":null,"unpublishAuthorizationDate":null,"status":null,"propertyTags":null,"zipcode":"37228","timezone":"EDT","name":"WZTV","channelBrand":null},"parentSection":{"uuid":"cf9293eb-3f44-4ba6-84f1-8a21ac697599","created":1437778094000,"version":1,"savedDate":null,"scheduledDate":null,"expiresDate":null,"terminatedDate":null,"publishAuthorizationDate":null,"unpublishAuthorizationDate":null,"status":null,"propertyTags":null,"zipcode":null,"timezone":null,"name":"Root","pathUrl":"\/","redirectPathUrl":null,"config":null,"parentChannelProperty":{"uuid":"0adc72e1-1860-4080-aec0-b4d43d69b55e","created":1437778093000,"version":1,"savedDate":null,"scheduledDate":null,"expiresDate":null,"terminatedDate":null,"publishAuthorizationDate":null,"unpublishAuthorizationDate":null,"status":null,"propertyTags":null,"zipcode":"37228","timezone":"EDT","name":"WZTV","channelBrand":null},"parentSection":null,"templateId":"blank","parentSite":null,"children":null,"presentations":null,"indexPresentation":null,"adZone":null,"geminiAdUnitIOS":null,"geminiAdUnitAndroid":null,"order":null,"locked":null,"imageUrl":null,"sectionLink":null,"sectionLinkText":null,"data":null},"templateId":"home-News3","parentSite":null,"children":null,"presentations":null,"indexPresentation":null,"adZone":null,"geminiAdUnitIOS":null,"geminiAdUnitAndroid":null,"order":null,"locked":null,"imageUrl":null,"sectionLink":null,"sectionLinkText":null,"data":null},"templateId":"section-News3_v1","parentSite":null,"children":null,"presentations":null,"indexPresentation":null,"adZone":"news\/local","geminiAdUnitIOS":null,"geminiAdUnitAndroid":null,"order":99,"locked":false,"imageUrl":null,"sectionLink":null,"sectionLinkText":null,"data":{"injectedMarkup":""}},"aud_story_detail":{"component":{"data":[]},"data":[],"componentInstanceId":"aud_story_detail"},"page-data":[],"DOTfeed":null}}</script><script>sinclairDigital.facade = JSON.parse(document.querySelector('script[data-prerender="facade"]').innerHTML);

Tenn. -- As COVID-19 continues to plague the country, people coming together to defeat the pandemic and the community impact is becoming even more apparent.{\/p}<p>But what's also more apparent is the hatred Asian Americans are facing.{\/p}<p>A local Chinese American organization called US TN Fujian Chamber of Commerce has given away thousands of surgical masks to places like local hospitals, medical centers, and anyone else who needs them.{\/p}<p>&ldquo;So far, we've donated over 15,000 masks to around 9 locations,&rdquo; says organization member Belle Huang.{\/p}<p>Huang says there are about 20 Chinese Americans of all ages in the organization who have donated and raised tens of thousands of dollars to import them from overseas.{\/p}<p>&ldquo;We have connections to Beijing so we're connecting with them and they're shipping it.&rdquo;{\/p}<p>Another local Chinese American group is doing the same.{\/p}<p>TNChinese-HelpDefeatCOVID-19 has raised more than $35,000 and donated 2,000 masks, 21,400 exam gloves, and four protective medical body-suits to hospitals and medical centers.{\/p}<p>But, despite all the good deeds, Asian Americans have become a target for racism.{\/p}<p>The Asian Pacific Policy & Planning Council says there have been 1,100 reports of harassment and physical assault just in the last couple of weeks.{\/p}<p>Verbal incidents like a woman yelling: &ldquo;Get out of our country! Get out. You! Get out of the United States!&rdquo;{\/p}<p>Or physical ones like a woman taking out her trash who was rushed to the hospital after being doused with chemicals that burned her face, neck, shoulders, and back.{\/p}<p>Huang says, thankfully, they haven't experienced that hatred but says it is frustrating and frightening to hear.{\/p}<p>She says they&rsquo;re focusing on the positives and says they will keep doing all they can to help the local community.{\/p}<p>{\/p}"},"rendering":{"adZone":"news\/local","webAdZoneRoot":"Web","mobileAdZoneRoot":"Mobile","dfpNetworkId":"4756","dfpAdUnitId":"WZTV","faviconImageUrl":"\/resources\/assets\/wztv\/images\/logos\/favicon.ico","pageTitle":"Nashville
